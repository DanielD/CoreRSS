<p>Congratulations to OG for claiming the Mystic Staff trophy to win their fourth Dota 2 Major Championship crown.</p>
<p>OG&#8217;s path through the Main Event bracket was forged with hard-fought victories over three stalwart teams. Managing to fend off a rally by Team Random and beat back early aggression by Team Faceless for a pair of 2-1 victories, OG then outlasted a resilient EG squad in two lengthy matches for a 2-0 series win and a berth in the Grand Finals.</p>
<p>Facing crowd favorite Virtus Pro in the best-of-five decider, OG jumped to an early one-game lead before dropping two straight matches to find themselves on the brink of elimination. Responding with a victory in game four, they set up only the second game-five deciding match in Major Championship circuit history. </p>
<p>Despite stellar play by Virtus Pro to grab an early advantage in the final match, OG held on to recover en route to another trip to the winner&#8217;s circle. As the only team with multiple Major Championship victories, the only prize OG has yet to claim is The International itself. </p>
<p>With The Kiev Major now complete, we would like to thank all of the participating teams and fans in Kiev, and all of the fans around the world who tuned in to watch the action unfold. We look forward to welcoming teams and fans alike to The International on August 7 &#8211; 12 in Seattle.</p>
<p>In preparation for the next event, <a href="http://www.dota2.com/majorsregistration/home/">team rosters have been unlocked</a>, and players are now able to manage their team affiliations. Teams have the opportunity to drop players until May 16, 12:00 a.m. PDT, and add players to their roster from that moment until May 24 12:00 a.m. PDT. From that point, rosters will remain locked until the conclusion of The International.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/blogfiles/blog_find_match.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s update focuses on improving the matchmaking experience with the restoration of Solo Queue, the addition of Phone Linking, and multiple other adjustments. </p>
<p>Quality matchmaking is a core component of an enjoyable Dota session, and today&#8217;s changes work to address several issues that can affect the player experience when queuing for a game.</p>
<p><b style="color: #b7b7b7">LINKED PHONE NUMBER</b></p>
<p>The first major change is that players must register a unique phone number to their account in order to queue for Ranked matches. </p>
<p>Players using multiple accounts create a negative matchmaking experience at all skill brackets, so our goal is to add just enough friction to this process that the number of players doing this will be noticeably reduced. Having more players using their primary accounts will have a positive effect on both Ranked and Unranked Matchmaking.</p>
<p>There will be a two-week grace period from today during which players have time to register a number, but starting on May 4th, accounts without a registered number will no longer be eligible for Ranked play. If a phone number is removed from an account after registration, a new number can be added, but there will be a three-month waiting period before the removed number can be registered on a new account. This is to prevent using the same number on multiple accounts. Online services that provide phone numbers are not allowed.</p>
<p><b style="color: #b7b7b7">SOLO QUEUE</b></p>
<p>With the return of the Solo Queue, solo players who enter Ranked Matchmaking can now choose to be matched only with other solo players. Any player who selects this option will be placed into matches where all ten players are queuing solo.</p>
<p><b style="color: #b7b7b7">PARTY CHANGES</b></p>
<p>Starting today, if a player&#8217;s Solo MMR is higher than their Party MMR, queuing in a party will result in the matchmaker assigning a higher MMR to that player. Effectively, these players will search for a match as if their MMR were halfway between the Solo and Party MMR values. </p>
<p>While the current Party MMR number generally reflects the likelihood that you’ll win a given match correctly, we’ve found that when a Solo MMR is dramatically higher than a Party MMR, the match becomes extremely volatile, resulting in an unpleasant and uncompetitive experience for both teams. </p>
<p>Simply having an even chance to win over the long run does not necessarily correlate to having competitive matches, but this change will make it so the matchmaker is able to take into account both the party teamwork skill component and the individual capability of the players on both teams. With both teams having this same mechanic applied to them, the chance for each team to win over a large sample will still be the same as before, but with reduced volatility on a per-match basis.</p>
<p><b style="color: #b7b7b7">MATCHMAKING BEHAVIOR</b></p>
<p>This update also includes several changes intended to remove undesirable behavior from the matchmaking pool. </p>
<p>First, being marked for low-priority matches now results in a duration-based ban from the Ranked queue, in addition to the current game-count-based low priority requirement. The ban will start at a low threshold of a few hours, and increase up to four days for players who are very frequently in low priority. </p>
<p>Next, it should go without saying that while the wide variety of playstyles that Dota players bring to a given match will always be welcome, intentionally ruining games for other players is never condoned. To help address concerns in this area, we&#8217;ve also added better detection for clear cases of intentional feeding, and will be applying stricter punishments to those who violate this rule.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve also added detection for users that are botting, and with this update have issued a permanent ban to a large number of recently-detected bot accounts. This should help resolve several areas in which these bot accounts have a negative effect on the experience of the Dota community.</p>
<p><b style="color: #b7b7b7">REGIONAL CHANGES</b></p>
<p>Ranked Matchmaking will no longer be available in South Africa, India, and Dubai. We will update these servers as the unranked populations in these regions grow to the critical mass needed to be able to support splitting the user base into Ranked and Unranked queues. </p>
<p>While there are some players that used these servers for Ranked, the low populations made them prime targets for various Ranked Matchmaking abuses. For the time being, players in these regions will need to join Ranked Matchmaking queues in one of the other nearby supported servers.</p>

<p><b style="color: #b7b7b7">THE KIEV MAJOR</b></p>
<p>Final preparations for The Kiev Major are in full swing, and the Swiss-style Group Stage kicks off on Monday, April 24 at 9:00 a.m. EEST. Make sure to fill out your Tournament Predictions and set your Fantasy Lineup, and then tune in via the Dota 2 client or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dotamajor">Twitch</a> to watch the action unfold.</p>
<p>After Group Stage wraps up, the single-elimination Main Event will kick off on Thursday, April 27 at 10:00 a.m EEST from the National Palace of Arts in Kiev, with sixteen of the world&#8217;s best Dota teams battling to capture the last Dota 2 Major Championship before The International in August.</p>
<p><b style="color: #b7b7b7">THE INTERNATIONAL</b></p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/blogfiles/blog_ti_two_pods.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Once a champion is crowned in Kiev to cap off the Winter season, the focus of the Dota community will turn towards The International and debates over who can walk away from this year&#8217;s tournament as the undisputed best Dota team in the world.</p>
<p>As such, it&#8217;s nearly time to unveil The International Battle Pass—once all immortals are sufficiently polished—and prepare for the annual celebration of top-tier Dota that draws fans, pros, and neophytes alike to KeyArena in Seattle. </p>
<p>This year, to distinguish the players who support The International and contribute directly to the tournament prize pool, all TI Battle Pass items will remain exclusive through next year&#8217;s International. Items that you earn can each be gifted once, and players who unlock Ultra Rare items will still be able to trade them as in the past.</p>
<p>For teams who would join the ranks of the year&#8217;s top tournament, The International Regional Qualifiers will be held on June 26th – 29th to determine the final contenders who will meet in Seattle August 7 &#8211; 12 for a chance at ultimate victory.</p>
<p><b style="color: #b7b7b7">TODAY&#8217;S UPDATE</b></p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/blogfiles/blog_hero_stats.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s update includes the addition of a Stats section to every hero&#8217;s About tab. Now you can easily see details on each hero&#8217;s Attributes and level gains; their base attack, defense, and mobility stats; and base health/mana pools and regeneration.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also updated the report-granting mechanism to scale directly with the number of games played, fixed the Player Conduct Summary not showing recent commends, and changed report functionality so enemy players can now only be reported for communication abuse.</p>
<p>There are also some performance improvements to help during teamfights on various low-end hardware configurations, and a fix has been added to stop calculating player XPM once they reach level 25.</p>

<p>The Kiev Major kicks off competition in less than two weeks, with Swiss-style Group Stage play on April 24 &#8211; 25, and the single-elimination Main Event taking place April 27 &#8211; 30 at the National Palace of Arts in Kiev, Ukraine.</p>
<p>Head to the Compendium section of your Battle Pass to open your Player Cards and fill out your Fantasy Lineups, make your Tournament Predictions, and see the full roster of broadcast talent.</p>
<p>Once the Group Stage concludes, you&#8217;ll also have the chance to fill out a Bracket Prediction for the Main Event. You&#8217;ll need to decide: Will old favorites reign supreme, or can another group of upstarts wreak havoc on the main stage? The more accurate your predictions, the more Battle Points that await you.</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming the teams, talent, and fans to Kiev for another showdown to determine who stands atop the best sixteen teams in the world.</p>

<p>This update includes the release of Player Cards for The Kiev Major. Head into the Compendium section of your Battle Pass to unwrap your cards and start planning Fantasy Challenge rosters. You can also add Player Cards to your Dota 2 profile to show off your favorites.</p>

<p>Announcing the Cosplay Competition at The International, featuring a $15,000 prize pool up for grabs during the Main Event of the year’s premier Dota 2 tournament. </p>
<p>We invite all dedicated cosplayers to craft their best Dota-themed costumes and make the journey to Seattle in August for the Main Event of The International. Contestants do not need to be event ticket holders—all cosplayers who register to participate will be admitted to a Prejudging Phase near the event venue. The Performance Finals will then take place on the Main Event stage to determine who will walk away with the winner’s share of the cash prize.</p>
<p>Regardless of placement in the competition, all registered cosplayers who meet entry requirements will also receive this year&#8217;s Dota 2 Cosplay Crest upon appearing in cosplay during the Prejudging Phase of the competition.</p>
<p>As with last year, the 2017 Cosplay Competition will be administered by PGL. Please visit <a href="http://cosplay.pglesports.com">PGL&#8217;s sign-up page</a> to register for more information.</p>
